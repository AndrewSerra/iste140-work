                        <p>
                            In our day-to-day lives, we don’t really observe all the details around use that an 
                            engineer or designer may have planted. Think of a microwave, it’s just a tool to heat 
                            up a meal right? Not so much. Think of the effort and research that may go into how each 
                            button is added or whether it should even be there. 
                        </p>

                            Over decades companies collect data on how these products are used. Then the devices go 
                            through their own evolution process. We design products to have less cognitive complexity 
                            during their usage process. This would be a much more critical example but imagine this: A 
                            pilot is flying the plane you are a passenger in. The instrumentation that they have to 
                            check is spread out on the dashboard. They keep moving their eyes from one end to the other, 
                            and it keeps going on for the duration of the flight. 
                        </p>

                            How can this be fixed? Operational complexity can be decreased by rearranging the instrumentation 
                            on the dashboard. An approach is to group tools that are checked one after the other in certain 
                            cases. One example of this is from research conducted by Manooch S. Saeedi at Western Kentucky 
                            University. The research focused on optimal cognitive load and motivation to solve math problems. 
                            Their findings in their first experiment showed that with a decrease in cognitive load and an increase 
                            in intrinsic motivation, there was an increase in performance.<var><sup>[6]</sup></var> This can apply to 
                            the user's performance on completing a task using a tool.

                            What will be explained in this website is how we are intrinsically motivated to interact with technology, 
                            and perform well to complete the actions we pursue. Continue to the page, <a href="./story.html">"The Story"</a>,

                        <p>
                            I'm Andrew Serra is a <var>5<sup>th</sup></var>-year Computer Engineering Student at the
                            Rochester Institute of Technology. I currently work as a Software
                            Engineer and on the side develop products that are considered software
                            tools for anyone. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mostly working on embedded applications and IoT but personal side
                            projects are focused on Web and Mobile Applications. As a full stack
                            developer I enjoy working on both ends of development.
                        </p>

                            Another interest is User Experience Design and motivational technologies.
                            A currently in the process of developing a text based game that is played
                            in the city you live in. This website is a very high level overview of my
                            research for this project.
