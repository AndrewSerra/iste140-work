                            The Self Determination Theory tries to explain the motivation and personality 
                            of humans. There are multiple factors that can have an effect on explaining motivation. 
                            The pillars of the explanation are autonomy, competence, and relatedness.<var><sup>[8]</sup></var>

                        <p>
                            In Self-Determination Theory, intrinsic motivation is considered the opposite of extrinsic. 
                            Instead of receiving rewards as motivators such as money, prizes, etc, intrinsic motivation 
                            requires nothing in return.<var><sup>[8]</sup></var> The sole purpose of motivation is wanting to be there because one 
                            enjoys being in that environment.

                        <h3 class="heading">Games</h3>
                        <p>
                            The most common enjoyable activity around the world may be playing games. But how do we define a 
                            game? The Merriam-Webster Dictionary designs it as: <blockquote>“A physical or mental competition conducted 
                            according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other.”<var><sup>[2]</sup></var></blockquote> 
                            This doesn’t really capture how one might feel being a part of a game. Wolfgang Kramer, a board game designer describes 
                            games as: <blockquote>“Games are objects which consist of components and rules and have certain criteria: rules, 
                            a goal, always changing course; chance; competition; common experience; equality; freedom; activity; 
                            diving into the world of the game; and no impact on reality.”<var><sup>[9]</sup></var></blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            The important keywords in this definition are a common experience, no impact on reality, and, a goal. 
                            Whether collaborating or alone, we all are on the same level, and goal and this does not change our 
                            life. Simply, we are there because we like it. These sandboxed environments help us feel safe and in 
                            another reality.

                        <h3 class="heading">How is this different from Gamification?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The words may sound similar but they are actually quite different. The last sentence of the 
                            previous paragraph carries importance in this distinction. Gamification does not target to 
                            have a sandboxed environment. It enhances the experience in a system, this may be ease in game-based 
                            learning environments or simply a chat application.<var><sup>[6]</sup></var> Similar to games, it can apply to both physical 
                            and virtual worlds. It can be encountered at your workplace or a language learning app.

                            As the term has gained more traction with the tech industry trying to make better user experiences, 
                            most people don’t know what it is actually doing. Gamification is the motivation for the engineering 
                            of technology. How extrinsic and intrinsic motivation be enhanced through certain game mechanics in a 
                            non-gaming environment is what we try to achieve.

                        <p>
                            Fitness and wearable devices are using gamification very effectively. One example is the Apple Watch 
                            activity circles. We are unaware but we subconsciously want to close those circles and it motivates us 
                            to be more active. Another is an example from Garmin devices with their mobile app. There are several 
                            challenges per month, one of them is a leaderboard that tracks how many steps a person takes. You can 
                            get motivated by others' activities if you feel like you fall behind others on the leaderboard.

                            At the Eindhoven University of Technology, there is research done regarding real-time data displays to 
                            other cyclists who ride together and how it motivates them. The service they have developed is called 
                            SocialBike<var><sup>[12]</sup></var>. On top of the rear wheel, there is a display showing the speed of that cyclist. The person 
                            behind can see the speed and ride along. One of the most significant findings was that intrinsic motivation
                            was spiking when there was a display that a cyclist can see. It created a relatedness between the two cyclists, 
                            and a sense of collaboration, enjoyment, and effort all increased compared to the control group.
